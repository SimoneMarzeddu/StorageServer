All that I had laid to the waste
My spirit broken and just memories remain
For every day claims a piece of me
Every waking hour claims my inner peace
My inner peace
As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong I was honor bound
I stand defiant I stand ever proud
I am the chosen
I am the guardian the guardian
