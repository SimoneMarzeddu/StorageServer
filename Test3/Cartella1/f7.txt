Blinded by hate brought by the fall
As I swear death to all
You will feel my vengeance
As I claim your mortal soul
I will punish and destroy
Those responsible for this ploy
I will seek a thousand deaths
I will bring a thousand years of war
All that I had taken away
My home is gone and my love ones slain
For every sleep claims a piece of me
Every waking moment every single dream
