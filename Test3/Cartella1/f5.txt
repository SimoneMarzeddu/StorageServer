Fellow armsmen, I ask you
"Will you follow me tonight to break their spine
And reclaim what once was mine?"
Those cravens backstabbed me, deceived me
Never shall I tolerate their crimes again
Now let the hunt begin (Yeah!)
Seven thousands souls scared and daunted such a tale of woe
Not too long ago this village was a golden scene of hope
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace restore our gloria
To live forever (Yeah!)
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer! (Yeah!)
I am the Lightbringer!
