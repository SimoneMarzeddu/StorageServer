As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong I was honor bound
I stand defiant I stand ever proud
I am the chosen
I am the guardian the guardian
Now I seek the blood of those
Who claimed the innocent
I will hunt the enemy to the last
I will banish and rejoice
The final breath of foes
You will see what you have made
You will see what I have finally become
