Time to roll the dice
You know I'm the type
Type to risk my life
Not afraid to die
Type to make you cry
Type to put a price
All up on your head
Do just what I said
I'ma straight up villain
Straight up villain
Yeah no feeling
Yeah no feeling
Straight up villain
Straight up villain
Yeah no feeling
Yeah no feeling
I'm alive but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of dread
Till you go pow
Is it really a surprise
If I'm playing with your mind
And I treat you like prize
Then I throw you to the side
And am I really that bad
If l love to make you mad
And get happy when your sad
Only care about a bag
