I'ma straight up villain
Straight up villain
Yeah no feeling
Yeah no feeling
Straight up villain
Straight up villain
Yeah no feeling
Yeah no feeling
I'm alive but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of dread
Till you go pow
Bang bang
You can do anything
No fear, no pain
Listen to your brain go
Go stupid, go dumb, go stupid and
Then we go insane whoa
Just do what I say
Follow me I'll lead the way
Time to roll the dice
You know I'm the type
Type to risk my life
Not afraid to die
Type to make you cry
Type to put a price
All up on your head
Do just what I said
I'ma straight up villain
Straight up villain
Yeah no feeling
Yeah no feeling
Straight up villain
Straight up villain
Yeah no feeling
Yeah no feeling
I'm alive but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of dread
Till you go pow
