In control
That's how I like it
And I'm never letting go, nah
Never had a soul
So you ain't taking anything from me
When you go, nah
I'll stay so deep inside your brain
And take you somewhere far away
Time to roll the dice
You know I'm the type
Type to risk my life
Not afraid to die
Type to make you cry
Type to put a price
All up on your head
Do just what I said
