Now listen fellow warriors I ask you
"Should my campaign come to an end?"
There's way more to avenge (Woah!)
Fifteen million souls living in this realm without much hope
Not too long ago this kingdom was a golden state of hope
(Yeah! Ah ah ah ah oh!)
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace restore our gloria
To live forever (Yeah!)
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer!
